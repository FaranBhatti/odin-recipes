## Introduction
An incredibly basic recipe website. The website will not look very pretty, just building it to build up HTML experience. Revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.

## Self-Reflection (what I've learned)

### Foundations: HTML
- Basics of HTML (eg. syntax)
- How to build an HTML boilerplate template & importance of it
- Image referencing absolute vs. relative
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Folder structure & linking webpages on a website
- Putting data into divisions and labelling them appropriately

### Foundations: CSS
- External sheet styling to pages
- Utilizing various selectors and combinators
- Descendent combinators

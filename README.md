# odin-recipes

## Introduction
An incredibly basic recipe website. The website will not look very pretty, just building it to build up HTML experience. Revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.

## Self-Reflection (what I've learned)
- Basics of HTML (syntax etc.)
- How to build a boilerplate template and what it consists of
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Folder structure & linking webpages on a website
